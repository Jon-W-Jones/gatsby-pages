  Gatsby's default starter
</h1>

This project started out as a learning website for Gatsbyjs by creating a basic website. This soon morphed into more by learning about Gatsby plugins and how easy they made the creation of a Blog.
After while this grew more interesting and is now is becoming a WIP for creation a combined Portfolio website as well as a blog (if I find interesting topics to talk about).
The plan is to host this on Netlify and a link will be added once that happens.
